        <p>Watering:

Understand the water requirements of your plants. Some prefer consistently moist soil, while others prefer to dry out slightly between watering.
Water plants at their base to avoid wetting the foliage, which can lead to fungal diseases.
Light:

Place plants in locations that provide the appropriate amount of light. Some plants need direct sunlight, while others thrive in low-light conditions.
Rotate indoor plants occasionally to ensure all sides receive light evenly..</p>
