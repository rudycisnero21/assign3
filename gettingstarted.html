        <p>Select a Suitable Location:

Choose a spot for your garden that receives adequate sunlight. Most plants require at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily.
Ensure the location has good drainage to prevent waterlogged soil.
Decide on Garden Type:

Determine the type of garden you want to create, such as a flower garden, vegetable garden, herb garden, or a mix of these. Your choice will influence plant selection.
Prepare the Soil:

Test your soil to understand its pH and nutrient levels. You can buy a soil testing kit or send a sample to a local agricultural extension office.
Based on the test results, amend the soil by adding organic matter like compost to improve its quality.
